# Insurance Risk Analysis (Excel Project)

## Overview
This project analyzes a healthcare insurance dataset using Excel to demonstrate data cleaning, risk flagging, and claim trend analysis.

## Steps Performed
- Cleaned dataset by handling missing values and duplicates
- Applied data validation for categorical consistency
- Created pivot tables to analyze:
  - Average claim by smoking status
  - Average claim by region
  - Average claim by risk level
- Built a rule-based risk flag using factors such as smoking, diabetes, and BMI
- Created charts to visualize trends

## Key Insight
High-risk records (based on smoking, diabetes, or BMI thresholds) showed significantly higher average claim amounts compared to standard-risk records.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- Pivot Tables
- Data Validation
- Conditional logic (IF, OR)

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning
- Data validation
- Risk flagging logic
- Trend analysis
- Data visualization
